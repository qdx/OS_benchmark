### Instructions

> - Each specific benchmark should be compiled with just "make", then ran under it's own folder with the compiled binaries. 
> - Most of the output of the code are simple floating numbers, because we analyze these output with another python script.
> - The analyze.py code is used to execute multiple experiments and calculate their mean with standard deviation.
